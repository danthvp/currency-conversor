# currency-conversor

Hi! My name is Daniel
I'm studying Front-End technologies. This is my very first project with JavaScript.


I tried to imitate Google's currency conversor. 
To build this little project I did not use any framework or API, it's just JavaScript.
I didn't followed any design line.
I used :root to set values in variables and I divide the code in different components, then I imported the components to the main document (style.css);

I hope you like this converter
